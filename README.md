### Introduction:   
It is a Gene Locater Application which locates genes from a dataset (CSV support for now). It uses Neural Networks to automatically learn the location of the Genes from a specified training set.
           
           
### Build :
It uses the following Anaconda Python Suite and implements usage of : 
1. Jupiter Notebooks
2. Scikit Learn
3. Keras
4. Numpy
5. Pandas
          
 In order to run the program yourself with your own data-set of genes, replace PATH in the Notebook with the path to your dataset: 
```
pd.read_csv('$PATH')
```
