### Introduction:   
           It is an Gene Locater Application which locates genes from a dataset (CSV support for now). It uses Neural Networks to automatically learn the location of the Genes from a specified training set.
           
           
### Build :
    It uses the following python libraries: 
          1. Keras
          2. Numpy
          3. Pandas
          4. Sci-Kit
          
 In order to run the program yourself with your own data-set of genes, replace PATH in the Notebook with the path to your dataset: 
```
pd.read_csv('$PATH')
```
